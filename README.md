# ðŸ©º Healthcare Analysis using Machine Learning

This project presents an in-depth **healthcare data analysis pipeline** using **Python and Machine Learning**.  
The goal is to explore healthcare-related parameters, perform feature analysis, detect relationships among indicators, and apply predictive models to derive meaningful insights that can support healthcare decisions.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Healthcare data is one of the richest and most complex datasets, containing several attributes related to **patients' health, environment, and socio-economic indicators**.  
This project aims to:
- Clean and preprocess healthcare data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Build and evaluate Machine Learning models
- Interpret important health-related trends and factors
